This article shows you the way to install the latest version of Eclipse on Linux. There are other ways to install Eclipse using scripts to automate the installation. However, I prefer the manual installation method explained in this article so that you know where your files go. Later if you want to remove the Eclipse, it is just two commands as explained at the end of the article.

If you do not have Java in your system, follow this link and install the Java 8 first.  Install OpenJDK 8.


Step 1:
Download the desired version of Eclipse from the official site:

    DOWNLOAD 



Step 2:
Open the Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and enter the following command to change the directory.

cd /opt

Copy

Step 3:
Enter the command given below to extract the Eclipse from ~/Downloads directory. If your downloaded file is in any other directory, replace the last parameter by the actual file path.

sudo tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/eclipse-jee-2019-12-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz

Copy

Step 4:
Open another Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and enter the following command to create a shortcut file for eclipse.

gedit eclipse.desktop

Copy

Step 5:
In the opened gedit, copy and paste the following text.

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Eclipse
Type=Application
Exec=/opt/eclipse/eclipse
Terminal=false
Icon=/opt/eclipse/icon.xpm
Comment=Integrated Development Environment
NoDisplay=false
Categories=Development;IDE;
Name[en]=Eclipse
Name[en_US]=Eclipse

Copy


Step 6:
Save and close the gedit.

Step 7:
Enter the following command in the terminal to install the shortcut.

sudo desktop-file-install eclipse.desktop

Copy

Now search for Eclipse in the dashboard and open it.


Upgrade Eclipse
If you have already installed Eclipse using the above method and would like to upgrade the Eclipse to the latest version, just remove the Eclipse from /opt director and follow Steps 1 to 3 from the installation process.

sudo rm -rf /opt/eclipse

Copy


Remove Eclipse
Removing the Eclipse installed as described in this article is just two lines of commands.

Step 1:
First, remove the menu entry you created in Step 7.

sudo rm /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop

Copy

Step 2:
Delete the /opt/eclipse folder.

sudo rm -rf /opt/eclipse
