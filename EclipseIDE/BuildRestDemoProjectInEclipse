In Eclipse switch to the Git Repositories view:  Top Menu, select Window --> View --> GitRepositories
select Clone a Git Repository and add the clone to this view.  It's the middle button to the left.
In the Clone Git Repository dialog enter the URI copied from the Github project RestDemo 2:  https://github.com/monicamarshall/RestDemo2.git
The other fields will fill in automatically.
Click Next on the next 2 dialogs.
In the next Dialog select the local destination where you want the clone to be saved on your local disk.  I selected /home/monica/pythonprojects.
Click on Finish.
After that select the project that appears in the git repositories view, right mouse click on it, then select import.
Select a location on your disk to import the github project RestDemo in the Eclipse IDE.
Right mouse click on the project and configure the interpreter to use Python located in the restdemo virtual environment.
Instructions on how to create the restdemo environment are located in the InstallPythonConfigureVirtualEnvironment text file.
Name your interpreter restdemo to easily find it later.

You are ready to run the RestDemo project.
